The purpose of this test is to ensure that text-selection can keep up even when relatively large numbers of characters are part of the selection. Since I haven&apos;t reached the end yet, let me keep going with more really quite useless text just to see if we hit a limit where it really starts to slow things down. However if it hasn&apos;t slowed down by now I&apos;m guessing that it won&apos;t slow down at all. But you never know for sure until you try it, so I am, and here is the result. Selection does bog down a little near the end but it&apos;s redraw related.</textPath></text></g><use xlink:href="../../../batikLogo.svg#Batik_Tag_Box"/></svg>
